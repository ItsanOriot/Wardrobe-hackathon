This GitHub repository contains the source code to our web-app, as well as the prompt used to produce it, an explanation of the tech-stack, and a performance report. The website itself is StyleIt, an AI-enabled virtual stylist and wardrobe manager. Users can upload wardrobe items into their virtual wardrobe, which are automatically labeled and sorted. Then they can speak to an AI stylist, powered by GPT-4o, that can suggest outfits, accessories, etc. This website's goal was to help people use their wardrobe to its fullest. In a time when fast fashion and disposable clothes dominate the fashion market, people feel a constant need to be trendy and stylish, and will shop for clothes that they will only wear a few times. This AI stylist can show people new ways to style their clothes, and give countless new outfits and takes on their wardrobe. StyleIt encourages sustainable fashion habits and helps people dress well with the clothes they already have.
