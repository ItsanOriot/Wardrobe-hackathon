## Troubleshooting

### Frontend can't connect to backend
1. Check `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` in Vercel environment variables
2. Verify backend is running: visit `/health` endpoint
3. Check browser console for CORS errors
4. Verify `FRONTEND_URL` is set correctly in Render

### Authentication errors
1. Check Supabase keys are correct
2. Verify Supabase project is active
3. Check RLS policies in Supabase
4. Test with Supabase dashboard

### Images not loading
1. Verify Supabase storage bucket exists
2. Check bucket is public or has correct RLS
3. Verify `next.config.ts` has Supabase domain
4. Check image URLs in database

### Backend errors
1. Check Render logs (Dashboard â†’ Logs)
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Check OpenAI API key is valid
4. Verify Supabase service key is correct

### Slow performance
1. Check Render instance type (upgrade from free tier)
2. Enable Vercel Edge Functions if needed
3. Optimize images in Supabase
4. Add caching headers
